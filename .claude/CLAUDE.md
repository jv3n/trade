# CLAUDE.md

Source of truth for project conventions and Claude-specific configuration. Read this first when working on PortfolioAI.

## Project

Per-ticker market intelligence app. For each ticker (held in the user's portfolio or watched), the backend fetches market data from Twelve Data, computes technical indicators server-side (RSI, MA, momentum, drawdown…), and the LLM produces a short narrative summary. **The LLM is a writer, not a decider** — it does not predict prices and does not output BUY/SELL signals; it digests indicators that the code computed and writes a short readable summary.

> Phase 0 (rebalance recommendations from RSS news + portfolio-wide LLM prompt) is **frozen** — the code remains in place but is no longer in the user flow. See `docs/metier/fonctionnalites.md` for the full phasing.

## Backend modules

- `market/` — `MarketChartClient` port (returns domain `MarketChart` = `TickerQuote` + `List<OhlcBar>`) with two adapters selected by `market.provider` : `TwelveDataClient` (REST + apikey, default prod) and `MockMarketChartClient` (deterministic synthetic data, default without key). `IndicatorCalculator` is Kotlin pur, sans Spring : RSI, MA50/MA200, momentum, drawdown.
- `analysis/` — Phase 1 ticker narrative pipeline (`TickerNarrativeService`, `TickerNarrativeRunner`, `TickerNarrativeParser`, `TickerNarrativeValidator`). Legacy portfolio-wide pipeline (`AnalysisExecutor`, `RecommendationValidator`, etc.) is **frozen in place** — code remains but no longer in the user flow.
- `portfolio/` — read-only portfolios, Wealthsimple CSV import, historical snapshots
- `ingestion/` — 🧊 legacy Phase 0 — RSS scheduler. Conservé en place, plus consommé en Phase 1.
- `shared/` — cross-cutting utilities (e.g. `GlobalExceptionHandler`)

> The LLM never computes indicators — they live in `IndicatorCalculator` (pure Kotlin, unit-tested). The LLM only produces the narrative summary from already-computed values.

## Frontend modules

Light hexagonal split under `frontend/src/app/` :

- `core/` — cross-feature data access split into ports + HTTP adapters : `<name>.repository.ts` (abstract class) + `adapters/<name>.http.ts` (`HttpXxxRepository`). Wired in `app.config.ts`. Currently 5 repositories : Portfolio, Analysis, Settings, Snapshot, Market. Also `theme.service.ts` and `language.service.ts` (both signal + persist localStorage, parallel shape).
- `features/` — UI feature folders (one per top-level route, *primary adapters* en vocabulaire hexagonal) :
  - `dashboard/` — portfolio view (read-only positions) + link to ticker dossiers
  - `ticker/` — per-symbol dossier (price chart, indicators, LLM narrative)
  - `import/` — Wealthsimple CSV drag-and-drop page
  - `suivi/` — import history (snapshots by date, market values, P&L)
  - `recommendations/` — 🧊 legacy Phase 0 — filterable list of recommendations
  - `history/` — 🧊 legacy Phase 0 — chronological recommendation history
  - `settings/` — back-office avec sidenav : `sources/` (activer/désactiver), `test-sources/` (tester un flux), `prompt-preview/` (aperçu du prompt LLM)

## Local Development

Full stack runs via Tilt + Docker Compose. See `docs/technique/developpement.md` for the full guide.

```bash
# Start everything: PostgreSQL, Ollama, backend, frontend
tilt up
```

Tilt UI: http://localhost:10350/

The backend boots with the `local` profile (`application-local.yml`, gitignored).

## Frontend Commands

All commands run from `frontend/`. Single Angular app, no monorepo.

```bash
npm run start    # dev server
npm run build    # build
npm run test     # tests (Vitest)
npm run format   # Prettier
```

To run a single test file with Vitest directly:

```bash
cd frontend
npx vitest run src/path/to/file.spec.ts
```

## Backend Commands

Run from `backend/`. Spring Boot + Kotlin DSL Gradle.

```bash
./gradlew bootRun        # start API locally
./gradlew test           # run tests
./gradlew spotlessApply  # ktfmt (Google style)
```

## Conventions

- Idiomatic Kotlin (data classes, sealed classes, extension functions)
- Spring Boot config in **YAML** (`application.yml` / `application-local.yml`)
- Angular standalone components (Angular 21)
- **Zoneless change detection** explicit — `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` in `app.config.ts`, no `zone.js` dependency. State is signal-based ; Default change detection strategy is fine, no need to add `OnPush` everywhere.
- **i18n via `ngx-translate`** — translation files in `frontend/public/i18n/<lang>.json` (FR + EN). Components import the `TranslatePipe` (not `TranslateModule`) ; templates use `'key' | translate`. Dynamic strings (errors set in TS) go through `TranslateService.instant('key', { params })`. Active locale lives in `LanguageService` (signal). **Never hard-code a user-facing string** — always pass through a translation key.
- Angular Material for all UI components
- Integration tests on real PostgreSQL (no DB mocks)
- Frontend tested with **Vitest** (not Karma, not Jest). Test specs that boot a component with templates using `translate` need `provideTranslateService({ lang: 'en' })` in their TestBed providers — without translations loaded, `instant('foo.bar')` returns the key as fallback (acceptable for assertions).
- `@Async` Spring: always on a separate bean — never `this.asyncMethod()` (bypasses AOP)
- LLM provider: **Claude API is the Phase 1 default** (`llm.provider: claude`). Ollama + `mistral` (7B Instruct) is kept as an offline backup but produces noticeably weaker narratives. Legacy Phase 0 timeouts (frontend abort + dedup window) are aligned at **400 s** to absorb Mistral latency on M1; Claude is much faster and may let us shrink that later.
- Commits in **English**, Conventional Commits — see `docs/projet/commit-conventions.md`
- Commit message proposals are always in **English**
- Never commit API keys. `application-local.yml` is gitignored
- `docs/data-input/` contains **fake** sample CSVs (versioned, used for smoke tests / demo / CI). Real Wealthsimple exports go in `docs/data-input-local/` which is gitignored — never move real exports into `data-input/`

## Instructions for Claude

### Builds and tests

Builds (`./gradlew`, `npm run build`) and tests (`./gradlew test`, `npm run test`) can be run when it helps tighten a feedback loop — e.g. validating a refactor, debugging a runtime error, confirming a fix. Use Tilt logs (UI on http://localhost:10350/, or `docker compose logs backend`) to inspect the running stack rather than re-running the whole build. CI is still authoritative for the full matrix.

### Git

The user manages git themselves (staging, committing, branching, shelving). When asked for a commit, **propose a Conventional Commits message in English** but do **not** run `git add` or `git commit` — the user picks what to stage and when. The same applies to `git push`, branch creation, PR opening : suggest, don't execute.

**Commit messages are one line, no body.** When asked for a commit name, output the single subject line in Conventional Commits format and stop. Don't follow up with a body, bullet list, or rationale block — the user pastes the line as-is. Keep the subject under ~72 characters. If the change really needs a body, raise that with the user instead of writing one preemptively.

### Tests as documentation

The user reads tests as the spec of the code under test. A test file should feel like a narrative — open it, read top to bottom, walk away understanding what the code does and why each scenario matters. Apply this when writing or modifying tests.

Concretely :

- **Class-level docstring** — one short paragraph naming the area under test, the failure modes the tests protect against, and the design intent (e.g. "parser must tolerate prose padding from local models, but reject malformed structure so the executor's retry loop has a precise error to feed back"). Skip only when the class has a single trivial test.
- **Test names are full sentences** (Kotlin backtick names, Vitest `it('…')` strings). Describe the *behavior*, not the mechanic : `rejects unknown sentiment` ✓, `test parser 5` ✗. Mirror real-world phrasing : `tolerates prose around the JSON object` reads like a spec line.
- **Inline comments** when the *why* is non-obvious : a real failure we observed, an edge case that surprised us, a regression we don't want to repeat. Comments explain motivation, not mechanics — `// Mistral 7B sometimes pads with "Sure! Here is..."` beats `// parses string`.
- **Setup factories with sensible defaults** (`parsed()`, `quote()`, `indicators()`) — each test then overrides only the field that matters, so the diff between scenarios is visible at a glance.
- **One scenario per test**, but multiple assertions are fine when they all describe the same scenario. `parses a clean JSON object` legitimately asserts `summary`, `sentiment` and `keyPoints` together.
- **Realistic fixtures over synthetic ones** when the cost is similar. `"Price above MA200, RSI 62"` reads better than `"x"`. The reader should recognize the domain even in a unit test.

### Portfolio philosophy

The portfolio is **read-only** in the UI — it mirrors the broker's reality. The only way to feed data is the Wealthsimple CSV import. No manual portfolio creation, no asset add/remove.

### Backlog

`docs/projet/backlog.md` is the source of truth for feature tracking. After implementing a feature:

1. Move the line from "À faire" to "Terminé"
2. Add concise technical notes in the Notes column

### Documentation

Files under `docs/` describe the actual state of the project. Keep them in sync as the code evolves:

| File                              | Update when…                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/metier/vision.md`           | The product framing or the LLM's role in the app changes                  |
| `docs/metier/fonctionnalites.md`  | A feature changes status, or a phase advances                             |
| `docs/technique/architecture.md`  | A new module, an important technical decision, or a new pattern is added |
| `docs/technique/developpement.md` | Local config changes, a Tilt command is added                             |
| `docs/technique/developper.md`    | Newcomer onboarding flow changes (new prerequisite, install step, common failure mode worth flagging) |
| `docs/projet/sources.md`          | A data source is added or removed                                         |
| `docs/projet/backlog.md`          | A Phase 1+ feature is implemented, frozen, or its priority changes        |
| `docs/projet/audits/`             | A code review is performed — archive the full report as `YYYY-MM-DD-titre-court.md` and append a line to `audits/index.md`. Don't auto-promote findings to the backlog ; the user decides which become actions. |

### Technical decisions

Whenever a technical decision is made (lib choice, dropped approach, architectural bug fix), record it in `docs/technique/architecture.md` under "Décisions techniques notables". This file is the memory of the *why*, not just the *what*.
